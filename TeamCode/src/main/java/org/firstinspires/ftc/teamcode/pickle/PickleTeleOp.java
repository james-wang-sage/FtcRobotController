 * This file includes a teleop (driver-controlled) file for the goBILDA® StarterBot for the
 * 2025-2026 FIRST® Tech Challenge season DECODE™. It uses a 4-motor MECANUM DRIVE system
 * for full omnidirectional robot mobility, one high-speed motor driving two "launcher wheels",
 * and two servos which feed that launcher.
 *
 * MECANUM WHEEL CONFIGURATION (4 Motors):
 * This robot uses goBILDA 104mm mecanum wheels with 4 motors (one per wheel).
 * This provides FULL omnidirectional movement:
 * - Forward/backward movement: Left stick Y-axis
 * - Strafing (side-to-side): Left stick X-axis
 * - Rotation: Right stick X-axis
 *
 * WHEEL ARRANGEMENT (viewed from above):
 *     FRONT
 *   FL     FR     (FL = Front Left, FR = Front Right)
 *     \   /       Arrows show roller direction
 *     /   \
 *   BL     BR     (BL = Back Left, BR = Back Right)
 *     BACK
 *
 * Likely the most niche concept we'll use in this example is closed-loop motor velocity control.
 * This control method reads the current speed as reported by the motor's encoder and applies a varying
 * amount of power to reach, and then hold a target velocity. The FTC SDK calls this control method
 * "RUN_USING_ENCODER". This contrasts to the default "RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER" where you control the power
 * applied to the motor directly.
 * Since the dynamics of a launcher wheel system varies greatly from those of most other FTC mechanisms,
 * we will also need to adjust the "PIDF" coefficients with some that are a better fit for our application.

     * 2. Gradually increase until launcher performs consistently
     * 3. Set MIN_VELOCITY about 50-100 ticks below TARGET for reliability

     * TECH TIP: State Machines
     * We use a "state machine" to control our launcher motor and feeder servos in this program.
     * The first step of a state machine is creating an enum that captures the different "states"
     * that our code can be in.
     * The core advantage of a state machine is that it allows us to continue to loop through all
     * of our code while only running specific code when it's necessary. We can continuously check
     * what "State" our machine is in, run the associated code, and when we are done with that step
     * move on to the next state.
     * This enum is called the "LaunchState". It reflects the current condition of the shooter
     * motor and we move through the enum when the user asks our code to fire a shot.
     * It starts at idle, when the user requests a launch, we enter SPIN_UP where we get the
     * motor up to speed, once it meets a minimum speed then it starts and then ends the launch process.
     * We can use higher level code to cycle through these states. But this allows us to write
     * functions and autonomous routines in a way that avoids loops within loops, and "waits".

         * For mecanum drive, motors on opposite sides spin in opposite directions to drive forward.

         *   - Right motors (FORWARD): Spin "forward" → wheels move forward
         *   - Result: Robot drives forward when all motors get positive power! ✓
         *
         * IMPORTANT: Test drive your robot! If the robot spins, strafes incorrectly, or moves
         * backward when expected to go forward, you may need to swap some direction settings.
         * Common issues:
         *   - Robot spins instead of driving straight: Check left/right directions
         *   - Robot drives backward: Swap ALL directions (REVERSE↔FORWARD)
         *   - Strafing goes wrong direction: Check diagonal motor pairs

         * 1. RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER (current default for drive motors)
         *    - What it does: Direct power control - you say "give 80% power," motor gets 80% power
         *    - Pros: Simple, responsive, instant reaction to joystick
         *    - Cons: Speed varies under load (slows down going uphill, speeds up downhill)
         *    - Best for: Teleop driving (what you're doing now) ✓
         *
         * 2. RUN_USING_ENCODER (what launcher uses below)
         *    - What it does: Closed-loop speed control - maintains constant velocity even under varying load
         *    - Pros: Consistent speed, smoother driving, maintains straight lines better
         *    - Cons: Slightly less responsive, requires encoders to be properly connected
         *    - Best for: Autonomous, or teleop if you want very smooth consistent driving
         *
         * 3. RUN_TO_POSITION
         *    - What it does: Drives to a specific encoder position then stops
         *    - Best for: Autonomous movements ("drive exactly 24 inches")
         *
         * You might want to switch drive motors to RUN_USING_ENCODER if:
         *    - Robot doesn't drive straight (one motor is weaker)
         *    - You want smoother, more consistent driving

         * - P (Proportional): 300
         *   Main corrective force. Higher = faster response but can cause oscillation.
         *   If motor overshoots/oscillates around target, decrease P.
         *   If motor is too slow to reach target, increase P.
         *
         * - I (Integral): 0
         *   Eliminates steady-state error over time. Usually 0 for velocity control.
         *   Only increase if motor consistently stays below target velocity.
         *
         * - D (Derivative): 0
         *   Dampens oscillation. Usually 0 for FTC velocity control.
         *   Increase slightly if you reduced P but still see oscillation.
         *
         * - F (Feedforward): 10
         *   Predictive component based on target velocity. Reduces reliance on P.
         *   Calculate as: F = (12V × 60) / (motor_free_speed_RPM × ticks_per_rev)
         *   For a 6000 RPM motor with 28 CPR: F ≈ (720) / (6000 × 28) ≈ 0.0043 per tick/sec
         *   Scaled value: 0.0043 × target_velocity ≈ 10 for this application
         *
         * TUNING PROCESS:
         * 1. Set F first using the formula above
         * 2. Start with P=100, increase until motor reaches target quickly
         * 3. If oscillating, reduce P by 20-30%
         * 4. Only adjust I/D if problems persist
         * 5. Test with actual game pieces - loaded performance may differ
         *
         * HARDWARE-SPECIFIC: These values are tuned for goBILDA 5203/5204 motors.

     * DEADBAND HELPER FUNCTION
     *
     * Treats small joystick values as zero to prevent drift from stick noise.
     *
     * How it works:
     *   - If |value| < deadband → return 0.0 (ignore noise)
     *   - Otherwise → return value as-is
     *
     * Example with deadband = 0.05:
     *   - Input: 0.03 → Output: 0.0 (robot stays still)
     *   - Input: -0.04 → Output: 0.0 (robot stays still)
     *   - Input: 0.8 → Output: 0.8 (normal movement)
     *   - Input: -0.6 → Output: -0.6 (normal movement)
